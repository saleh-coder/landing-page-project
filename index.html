                        <figcaption>This image reflects the thoughtful process of choosing the right HTML
                            structure—balancing
                            ideas and
                            learning to solve
                            problems creatively.

                        <figcaption>This image represents my feelings as I start adding classes to elements—anticipating
                            how
                            I'll manage and
                            style them later in the CSS file, feeling both organized and a bit overwhelmed by the
                            possibilities.

                            block—reminding me that pauses and reflection are part of the process, and new ideas will
                            come

<!-- Os atributos width e height nas imagens são úteis, mas como nota você já tem, definir tamanho com CSS dá mais flexibilidade, especialmente para responsividade futura. -->

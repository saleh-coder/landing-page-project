# Landing Page Project

This project is a complete web page created based on a design provided by The Odin Project Foundations course. The main goal was to build a functional and visually organized landing page using HTML and CSS, applying the best practices learned during the course.

## About the Project

For this challenge, the task was to develop a static website based on a design, which included:

- A **header** with navigation links.
- A **hero** section with a headline, text, and image.
- Intermediate sections for diverse content.
- A simple, well-aligned footer.

The design came with reference images showing the full website and details about fonts and colors to assist implementation.

## Technologies Used

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 with Flexbox for layout and alignment
- Git and GitHub for version control and hosting via GitHub Pages

---

## How I Built It

1. **HTML structure**: Created the page markup dividing it into main sections (header, hero, main content, footer).
2. **CSS styling**: Applied styles following the color palette and typography provided, using BEM methodology for organized class naming.
3. **Layout adjustments**: Used Flexbox to align elements horizontally and vertically with consistent spacing.
4. **Hosting**: Published the project on GitHub Pages for public access.
